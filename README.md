# CLI Help Menu Designer (Tkinter + argparse)

A lightweight **GUI tool for designing argparse help menus**. Build up your CLI’s arguments visually, preview the generated `--help` output live (including terminal width wrapping), then export a runnable Python CLI scaffold.

Created as a productivity helper for quickly prototyping consistent CLI interfaces.

## What it does

- **Edit program metadata**
  - Program name (`prog`)
  - Program description (`description`)
- **Add / remove arguments**
  - Flags (boolean `store_true`)
  - Options (string-valued args)
- **Preview the help menu live**
  - Uses `argparse.ArgumentParser.print_help()`
  - Adjustable terminal width to see wrapping behaviour
- **Export a CLI starter script**
  - Writes an autogenerated `cli.py` containing the parser setup + your arguments

---

## Screens / UX notes

The GUI shows:

- Program name + description
- A **Terminal Width** slider (40–120 columns)
- An **Arguments** editor list (name, flags, help text, type)
- A scrollable **Help Menu Preview**
- Buttons:
  - **Add Argument**
  - **Export Code** (writes `cli.py`)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library only:
  - `tkinter`
  - `argparse`

No third-party dependencies.

---

## Run

```bash
python cli_menu_designer.py
```
### Generated output

When you click Export Code, the tool writes a file called:

- cli.py
  
This exported cli.py includes:

- argparse.ArgumentParser(...) with your program name/description and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter width setting
- All defined arguments
- A starter main() and print(args) placeholder
A sample exported script is included in this repo as cli_sample.py.

---

### How arguments are interpreted

Each argument row includes:

- Flags: a single string, e.g. -v, --verbose
- Type
  - flag → exported as action="store_true"
  - option → exported as a normal argument expecting a value

> Note: This tool currently treats option arguments as string-valued and does not yet expose advanced argparse features (choices, default, type coercion, nargs, subcommands, etc.).

### Caveats / Known limitations

- The “flags” field is stored as a single string (e.g. "-v, --verbose"). argparse typically expects flags as separate tokens ("-v", "--verbose").
If you want strict argparse correctness for multi-flag aliases, you may want to edit the exported cli.py accordingly.

- Export overwrites cli.py in the working directory.
- Intended as a prototype/scaffolding tool, not a full CLI framework.

### Why this exists

If you frequently spin up small Python CLIs, the part that’s easiest to get wrong (or least enjoyable) is the initial argparse boilerplate and the help formatting.

This tool gives you:

- quick iteration,
- predictable help output,
- and an instant code scaffold you can paste into real projects.
